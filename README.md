# Data_visualisation_project

Data Visualization Final Project - Master of Data Science at the University of Luxembourg

In this project, our goal is to gain a clear understanding of a giving data by visualizing it. The data is an HR dataset from Kaggle (find the link below). The visual plots we create should be self-explanatory and incorporate at least three dimensions (aesthetics) in each plot using ggplot. We will apply the relevant principles discussed in the course. We will be using R programming lamguage to create visual representations of a HR dataset, which includes information about workers in a company, such as gender, race, position, salary, state, department, and more. Our process involves showcasing the data, defining three research questions that we want to explore through visualization, cleaning the data to ensure it is organized and complete (handling missing values, data types, encoding, and aggregating computations), and finally, creating appropriate plots to effectively convey the information related to our research questions.

The result must be in publication quality and should be self-explanatory. Ideally, mapping at least three dimensions (aesthetics in ggplot) into each plot. Positive points are awarded for meaningful appropriate of the principles discussed in the course - data to ink ratio, show the data, appropriate plot selection. The project has to be submitted by January 9th, 2022, 23:59 CET.
